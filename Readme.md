This libary has copyright and should not be used carelessly. this is an open source library and can be used
by anyone who wants to build a website and would need the functionalities of this library...
There are a variety of different function in this library. i hope they are useful and help make your work
wa faster when designing web applications or in cases where you need to build 'User Experience' interfaces

The Functions orientation begins here:    -__-

1) add(a,b) /** HOW THE FUNCTIONS WORK **/;
   This function is meant to add two value together which shortens the 'math.add(2,4)' and answer is '6' which
   the time you use the project.. it might not look like a big difference but it is easier to remember and they are
   more functions which actually shorten complexity

   e.g the 'googleSearch(input)' function... this function just requires you to give and id to the html
   element you want to search from e.g below
   `<input type="text" id="googleInputReceive" placeholder="search here">` `<button onclick="googleSearch('/fill in the id of the input tag and that's all/')">` search btn `</button>`

   <!-- for example, if the 'id' of the input element = "googleInputReceiver" then in the event listener that you use to call the function you will fill in the from id name e.g below
   <button onclick="googleSearch('googleInputReceiver')"> search btn </button> -->

   <script src = "https://main/lib/new/main.js"></script>
